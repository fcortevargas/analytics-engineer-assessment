Hi!

You might be wondering why there is a bonus folder included in my assessment answers. During my first interview, I wanted to showcase my ability to learn quickly and independently. To demonstrate this, I challenged myself to create dbt models for building the data mart I described in the first question of this assignment.

In the bonus folder, you'll find the dbt project I developed. I would like to highlight the contents of the models folder, which includes the dbt models and tests that structure the data mart using the data you provided.

I hope that this can serve as proof of my eagerness to learn and adapt to new tools, such as dbt, which I was unfamiliar with before this project. I also hope that this shows my commitment and motivation to learn and integrate into TicketSwap's workflow and my ability to independently learn new skills.

Please feel free to ignore this part altogether, as it was not a requirement of the assignment. Regardless, this project was a valuable and enjoyable learning experience for me.

Thank you for considering my work, and I look forward to your feedback!
